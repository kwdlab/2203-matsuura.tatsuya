Overview
This is an implementation of Simplified DES using Python. When executed, the program will encrypt or decrypt the input and output the result.

Description
Simplified_DES_Classical is a program which implements the Simplified DES using Python.
Simplified_DES_Classical_test is a program which tests the all possible imputs of Simplified_DES_Classical and measure the time taken.
Simplified_DES_Quantum is a progtam which implements the Simplified DES using Qiskit.
Simplified_DES_Quantum_test is a program which tests the quantum circuit using Hadamard gates and measure the time taken.

Requirement
Python 3.9.7
Qiskit 0.30.0
